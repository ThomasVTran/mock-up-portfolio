# Title
Mock-up-portfolio

## Description
<!-- This mock webpage serves simultaneously as not only a practice for my HTML and CSS skills, but also as a frame of refrence for whenever I need some sort of small project to remind myself of what HTML or CSS I am missing, if any at all. Upon the assembly, this project flushed out accessiblity issues with CSS consolidation and reorganization. One of the navigation text was not sending users to the paragraph respectively, so I changed it's directive. Added all of my comments to separate sections and point out minor changes I have made to styles. -->
This mock portfolio allows for me, as a new developer in training, to freely express my creativity, share my socials, and show off my work. As a new website developer this project allowed me to work from scratch and build something as a foundation for the future. Not only is my portfolio available for viewing on computers but the page also formats itself per the viewing port. Soon I hope to revisit this portfolio as a guideline and refrence for a future portfolio suited for whicheverever company's needs.
