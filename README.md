# Title
Mock-up-portfolio

## Description
This mock portfolio allows for me, as a new developer in training, to freely express my creativity, share my socials, and show off my work. As a new website developer this project allowed me to work from scratch and build something as a foundation for the future. Not only is my portfolio available for viewing on computers but the page also formats itself per the viewing port. Soon I hope to revisit this portfolio as a guideline and refrence for a future portfolio suited for whicheverever company's needs.
